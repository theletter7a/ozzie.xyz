                If a cell needs to move materials from HIGH osmotic pressure to LOW osmetic pressure, no ATP is required. This is called <b>Passive Transport. </b>
                If a cell needs to move materials from LOW to HIGH, it needs ATP for <b>Active Transport</b>

                A cell is <b>Hypotponic</b> if its salinity level is lower than the salinity level of the substance it is in. If it is higher, then its <b>Hypertonic</b>
                 The cell will naturally try to reach an <b>Isotonic</b> equillibrium.

                Some cells will mutate and form new structures for movement like <b>flagella and cillia</b> or photoreceptors like <b>Eye Spots</b>
                These mutations give the cells a survival advantage in their environment, which means their offspring will have a better chance of reproducing.
                This eventually leads to an almost universal aqcuisition of such useful traits.
